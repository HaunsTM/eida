            <p class="font-weight-light font-italic">The word sulten is a Scanian (Sk&aring;nskt) dialectal word for "hungry". The domain name summarizes pretty much what the site is about:
                a place to go for lunch. Or, at least virtually visit before deciding where to go for a real meal!
            </p>
            <h1 class="subtitle-1">Hardware and setup</h1>
            <p>
                From a hardware perspective, the site is set up and configured on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. 
            </p>
            <p>The host holds a minimal distribution of Raspbian 
                Buster (a Linux Debian distro), SSL, NGINX, MariaDB, PHP, Node.js-server, PM2 (daemon process manager for Node.js), Node-red.
            </p>
            <h1 class="subtitle-1">Backend</h1>
            <p>
                The backend project, <i>sulten</i>, is a Node.js-application written in Typescript. The main purpose of the backend is to act as an analyzing 
                business logic while ferreting lunch data out from different restaurants' web pages in Malm√∂ and Lund. After the raw data has been collected,
                it's analyzed and prepared for storage in a database before re-distribution as structured JSON to different clients via a REST API.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since there does not exist any standard format for how lunch menus are presented on different web pages, there was a need for pretty
                sophisticated usage of XPaths and Regular Expressions. Sometimes, menus were distributed as PDF, other as HTML.
            </p>
            <h1 class="subtitle-1">Frontend</h1>
            <p>
                The frontend part, <i>eida</i> (also a play with a Scanian phonetic for eat), is written in VueJS 2.6 with typescript.
                For material styling/behavior, Vuetify 2 framework was used.
